            Create a new repository for today called chocolate-pizza. Follow the pair programming work flow by having
            one user fork the other so that you can get some practice in your Git processes. Be sure to do frequent
            commits, and always do your work on branches. Before starting coding, think about a strategy for approaching
            this project. Before writing code, think about a practical order in which to do the work.
